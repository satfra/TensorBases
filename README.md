# TensorBases

TensorBases is a Mathematica package which provides common interaction bases used in functional computations, with a specific focus on QCD-related interactions.

## Installation

To install the TensorBases package in Mathematica, simply open a new notebook or kernel and download the installation file:

```Mathematica
Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satfra/TensorBases/main/TensorBasesInstaller.m"]
```

The installer will automatically download the package and all basis definition files and their pre-built cache.

## Usage

To see how to use the package, you can open the example notebook [`examples/Showcase.nb`](https://github.com/satfra/TensorBases/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/Showcase.nb) included in the package.
