# TensorBases
TensorBases is a Mathematica package which provides common interaction bases used in functional computations, with a specific focus on QCD-related interactions.

## Installation

To install the TensorBases package in Mathematica, simply open a new notebook or kernel and donwload the installation file:
```
  Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satfra/TensorBases/main/TensorBasesInstaller.m"]
```
The installer will automatically download the package and all basis definition files and their pre-built cache.
